# A simple IRC Client

This program is a simple IRC client, with a bare minimum interface. 

This project had much more to do with learning about software development (writing requirements documents, documenting and outlining costs and changes, etc.) 
than actually developing a really well designed IRC client. We learned a bit about GUIs, although that was not really our focus. Regardless, I kept it here to show off work with GUIs and such.
