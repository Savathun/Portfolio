Date: January 2021

Not much more than the algorithm itself, checking a text input to see if it can be decrypted with a caesar cipher. An attempt to optimize the algorithm was made by checking the most common letter in the string and checking it against the letters in the english language by order of commonality, i.e., checking to see if the most common letter in the string decoded to e, then t, etc.
