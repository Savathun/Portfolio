## Description:

This is a vulnerability scanner made in python. It is intended to scan websites for XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

It can extract internal links, scan for subdomains, and then scan each webpage found for vulnerabilities.

## Disclaimer:

This program should be used to scan ones own websites, or another's websites only with the website owners permission! Doing otherwise may cause problems for the website owner.

Additionally, not all of this code is our own. Credit has been made at the top of each module as to where we took ideas and code from to modify for use in this project.
