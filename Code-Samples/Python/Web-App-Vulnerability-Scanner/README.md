Assignment: Final Project

## Instructions:

In order to run this program, you must run the commands at the command prompt:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 driver.py
```

That's all. Then the program will prompt for additional input from you from there.

## Description:

This is a vulnerability scanner made in python. It is intended to scan websites for XSS and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

It can extract internal links, scan for subdomains, and then scan each webpage found for vulnerabilities.

## Disclaimer:

This program should be used to scan ones own websites, or another's websites only with the website owners permission! Doing otherwise may cause problems for the website owner.

Additionally, not all of this code is our own. Credit has been made at the top of each module as to where we took ideas and code from to modify for use in this project.

## Project Notes:

We initially intended to be far more ambitious with this project but found that we simply did not understand the vulnerabilities, or how the web worked well enough to include much else. As it is, we had to learn a lot more about how the web works to do the crawling and subdomain scanning, in addition to how to actually implement injecting the SQL and XSS automatically. It seemed simple enough on the surface, but if we were to do this project again we would have narrowed the scope significantly and probably just focused on one really well implemented scanner for one type of vulnerability.
